    "Given that the insertion and deletion operator are not required for this data structure and the index of element can maintain unchanged during calculation, a simple 2D array will be good enough for this purpose. Since there is a large number of radial basis fields, it may have problem store all of the data in a continuous block(although it will be the most efficient implementation given enough memory). So the 2D array can be implemented as \"array of pointers\", with each pointer pointed to a 1D array(dynamically allocated in heap), which represents the position of the neuron. The indexing of array can be done in O(1), which makes the data accessing speed of 2D array much faster than other complicate datastructure(linked list, hash table for example). Here is an example of the implication (in c++):\n"
