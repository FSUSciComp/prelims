In order to update the list(L) for one neuron(A), firstly check if the neighboring neurons in the list L are still in the radius R, delete if not, then delet A from the neighboring list of the deleted neurons. Then perform a BFS using the neuron A as root for 2 steps(with neighboring neurons in L as child), which generate a tree of 3 level. Check if the leafs of the tree is in the radius R, if true add the positive leaf into list L, and add A into the neighboring list of the positive leafs.
