    "$\\textbf{Add/subtract}$ count is: $$(n-1)(b + 3p(d)) \\approx n(\\frac{1}{3}p^3 + \\frac{3}{2} p^3) = n(\\frac{11}{6}p^3) \\approx \\mathcal{O}(2np^3)$$\n",

    "Note that the above multiply/divide count is very close to the multiplication count of $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{7}{3}np^3)$ given on page 5 of the paper linked to at the bottom of this notebook. Our operation count is slightly lower because the matrix-matrix product in $U_i = A_i - L_iD_{i-1}$ involves a diagonal matrix according to question 4., which means we will have fewer operations than the general case.\n",
