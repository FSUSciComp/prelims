Because  cond(H)is defined by: $\\lambda_{max}(H)/\\lambda_{min}(H)$ , thus if the condition number is large, which means the eigen values varies a lot, the Hessian matrix will resize the length of the vector $\\Delta f$ very differently based on the direction of $\\Delta f$. If the direction of $\\Delta f$ is approximate to the eigenvector corresponding to the $\\lambda_{max}(H)$, the length of $H\\Delta f$ could be much larger compared to $\\Delta f$, thus lead to unstable."
